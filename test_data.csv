Cab driver  Soon 
Number is not getting updated . Uber pls help 
Very good utility 
Scam  The price surcharge thing has become the rule rather than the exception. Completely useless app nowadays. 
Stop Cheating  Increasing Price Silenty & Does not Show Fare Hike. I hate Uber. Company now making chutiya & Looting Customers. 
Brent Hunter  Loved the Uber experience
Lately
Easy  Good 
Good service  Service and rates were really very good n absolutely affording but now I think money mindedness has taken over... the rates have gone terribly high now a days... plz look into d matter n do the needful at d earliest 
Love uber ‚ô° 
I had waited for a taxi in Hyderabad for 2 hours and not even one taxi arrived. Its the worst app ever. Instead of this using an auto rickshaw is comfortable. 
Complain  Driver used the payment terms to get more profit
Uber is a good app  Good service

Ask for more money after the update  It's okay of its just for a few hours but surge pricing just keeps popping up like everyday and I saw lots of Uber drivers like any other day in my area which is weird. 
Used it liked it  SURGE fairs are a rip off.... But otherwise prompt service... 
Every time surge price  I have been using uber regularly and realised that for same distance
Lovely  Best service 
So fast  So fast service 
For the last ride where the cab didn't turned up and Uber has charged me 60rs for cancellations 
I want free  Ride 
This is the future.  This will kill public transport in a couple years. This is the future.

Sh*t drivers  Works ok most of the time but the one time I am on a tight schedule the driver is late and then cancels the ride after deciding not to cross the street

Marvellous 
Always surge price 
2times the driver did not follow my directions and the fares were too high!! 
Super machi 
Round n Round  Easy to use.. Only drawback is the drivers follow the maps. They go round n round n round n drop eventually costing note den shown 
Yay  Awesome 
Used to provide good service. But these days Uber always charges more than normal fare. Everytime I see there is a surge charge applied. Also customer care is service is worst. They don't even read the email and just go on talking all non sense. Most important is that you cannot change the payment mode once you have booked a ride. Last but not the least
anand  good 
Useful but vans need to be removed from UberBlack  Recently the option to select Sedan was removed and all I get are vans. This is in Hong Kong. 
jakie  it's a very nice apps...                       but at present they already click start trip before coming!.......   why?    can u give this answer? plz....... 
Really cheap rates  Good 
Worst service  Initially everything seems like good but once they get a good market  they  showed the worst thing like others
Sering sih naik uber dan servisnya bagus semua tapi sekalinya dapet supir brengsek gak lagi pake uber 
Bad experience  Poor customer service 
Very very good 
Asiya.  It's v.good. 
Cheater  Uber is just cheating the coustmers. I have booked the Uber.Getting late to catch the train.  Waited for 20mins. No cab came. Even driver's no. Was busy. I have to book an auto to catch train. Hate this app 
Love  Mahesh 
I love my uber 
Wouldn't read or accept my Wells Fargo debit card  I'm disappointed but I know it works for everybody else thumbs upüñíüñí 
Uber  Not yet started 
It doesn't work  It doesn't work on my phone. So it sucks from my point of view 
Very bad  Its ok

Just another Taxi Service  The reason I migrated from taxi was driver attitude and refusal to take short trip. Same thing is happening here as well. Same taxi drivers have started coming in with their same attitude and total disrespect.

Fair Estimator!?  Where is the fair Estimator!? 
Stupid ads  They always come in all the apps and irritate the user ... These ads are very boring and also the app is very confusing to useüòµüòµüòµ 
Very cheap and sophisticated 
Sal Ruiz  Honestly 
Worst service  Uber service is the worst service 
Few features needed  No doubt. Good service. But inefficient if compared to Ola... Features like ride later. To schedule a ride in advance is missing... Secondly users have to install Uber App on phone&can't be shifted to sd card.which is not a mandatory in Ola.  Which is non preferable by many users... So finally Ola is much more flexible.... And better choice in terms of privacy....... Eventually for me... Ola wins the race.... And one more point.... Where is the customer care....??? No contact numbers for any contact center 
Fantastic services!  Much much much better than Ola cabs..  Hope you guys retain the same quality of service. 100% customers satisfaction! 
Good  Love UBER over OLA because of his simple App bookings & cost effective. Also had any issues
Poor service
Ride 
Good  Feeling Satisfy 
User App is a must have 
Speed  Provide better performance even on lower internet speeds. Very inconvenient when on data sometimes as it uses too much data. 
Stupid app  Hangs whenever you try to cancel the ride 
Aws  Nnnnn 
Ride on time  It's been very useful but a little pricy on a limited budget. I like how there is always nearby 
Additional charges when cancelling a trip  Not sure why you are charging when I cancel my trip. What should I do in a case where there is a delay from driver end. Last two times I've been told to wait for more than thirty minutes

The Best  I Love UBER 
blessing for ladies&children.  now time to go with uber.doing job is easier then before. 
Every moment  highfare 
Refuses to use my preferences  The app is fine and functionally works. My beef is with their refusal to use the android API to pick up my date preferences: I've set my phone to display things in the format I understand and I would like uber to respect that. I don't want to have to convert between USA dates or 12-&gt;24 hours. Yes
BAD BAD BAD  SANGAT BURUK. Driver uber yg MINTA CANCEL. dengan alasan: TUJUAN JAUH. SAYA KIRA CUMA DEKET DEKET AJA ANTERNYA. saya ga pake promo loh. Cash tanpa PROMO!! Lalu Saya kena DENDA 10rb?!! Itu kan salah driver! SO BAD! KECEWA. 
Customer service support is worst  Cab service is good whereas Customer service support is worst.. 
Wow  Sup 
Good service  Drivers are well behaved
Easy convence  Very affordable prices for any traveling

Neat

Spammed  Spammy pop-up ad wouldn't allow me to close it. Any attempt brought me to download page. I liked it before. Now? Uninstalled. 
Not signing in  Showing network error every time. 
No one showed up to get my daughter ! Not good! 
Good Apps  Not bad for travelling. . 
Worst app and support ever have!  They don't have any idea about what their system is doing. If you get blocked by system 
Uber  Travel like kubers 
Used to be good!  With the latest update to the app
Service is good  app is meh
I Value My Life  The driver smelled like old garlic. The car creaked and groaned. When was it  serviced last? Was the insurance current? Did the driver have a current license? Thanks
Bigger thief 
Good service in chennai  Only problem is trip gets cancelled in middle of journey causing confusion. 
Sucks  Where the hell is your customer care contact no. I really don't understand how anyone can be so much carefree for their customers. I hope your ESTEEM company will have more customers but when they will try to contact you regarding any query or problem
Uber helpfull 
I don't want this pre installed application on my phone  Please don't force ur useless service application in at&t phones and on other cell phone providers ... If anyone wants to use this application then he/she will download and run the application
Surge price not displayed while booking ride  Surge price not visible while booking the ride and for the same ride

Cancelling  How do you cancel one of your uber account 
Well done team!  Nyc n trusted  drivers appointed 
I love it  Because its giving excellent services and performance.üòä 
Invitatio  Thank you 
Bad service  Really bad service. They charged anything in pool also by saying the destination was different and don't reply on email or call. I guess ola is way better. 
Right price  Fare is better then app 
Uber is best app ever 
Awsm  Awsm 
Waste of time  Will not allow to register or sign in. After sign up showing a message that my account is disabled. Waste of time. Tried to sign up with 2 different mail ids
If the driver ask to cancel the trip still we need to pay the cancellation fee...... For what:@ 
Higher fares  I tried it today becos a friend told me it less costly but i ended up paying double the amount ordinary cab charges
First time user.  Impressed 
Nice app and help me a lot 
Service is promt n good  My personal experience is very good with v good with uber n it is much better than ola
RIDER. 5X. A WEEK LOVE THIS APP  Reg Custmer. 
Is very much baby 
estimated and actual price differ alot  I take uber last time shows fare without showing any peak hours 125 but after finish my ride I got a bill of 375. . dumb services ... 
Unsatisfied  Not accepting any of my cards .... Saying it is invalid when I know it's not 
Amazing! 
No  didn't install it.
Nice but...  I wish it allows you to pick your destination interactively from the map as well just like it allows for the pick up location. Not every country has addresses to locations where you want to go. 
U 
Fine but advance booking option  Introduce the advance booking option for who in travel in early morning and late night. 
Love uber  It's cool new convenient 
App is very slow and terrible  App is always show we are sorry for delay with a good speed  of wifi. Developers should work on it. 
UHULLLL  MARAVILHAAAAA 
Very Usefull app 
Assholes  Driver blamed Uber for navigation problems. He did not take my first call. He took my second and then drove right by me. He did not take my third call or call me. Instead he cancelled the trip no doubt to get some new quick money. I was stranded having to walk to a hotel line to get a cab. This driver should be fired. Uber should call me to apologize and compensate me. If not
It's really good  I like this 
Uber Partner  Very informative 
The best  Rides 
Easy  Its so easy to go out using uber

I can't get app 
It slow in downlaoding 
Where the car  Very nice app 
Drivers  He stole my bag and refused to give me my stuff back do not trust this app for the drivers 
Great app  I have a galaxy s7 edge and can't get the icon to come up on my screen. 
Cool app  Love rides are here fast 
Quick legit and great seevice 
Service Feedback very poor  For an app centered around its users experience
Ok  It is good
